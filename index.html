        <div class="content-text">
          <p>John Smith needed a portfolio website to host his blog and photography projects; Another medium for all of his followers to keep up with him. He was firm in his request, however, that he did not want a cookie-cutter Wordpress site. He needed a customized website built on a modern tech-stack that provided speed and efficiency. Additionally, as a content creator, John wanted complete control over how and where his content was displayed but he also did not have the time to deal with the hassles of scaling, hosting, constant maintenance, etc.<br><br>With all of those items to consider, I built this website using the React.js framework, a headless CMS (Sanity), Tailwind CSS, and hosted it on Netlify. React was the obvious choice to build this project upon because it allows for quick rendering of the DOM, as well as a component-based coding structure that could be leveraged for easy website changes and upgrades in the future. Sanity, an extremely powerful and flexible content management system, was used as the backbone for this website. It allowed me to provide John a completely customized backend solution to easily manage all of his content in a user-friendly way. Now, any updates or new content that John adds using his Sanity dashboard will be rendered on his website immediately!<br><br>Tailwind CSS is a simple but powerful CSS framework that I decided to implement in this project to quickly and efficiently build an eye-catching user interface. It also provides more flexibility than other CSS frameworks and will make it easy for another developer (or team of developers) to build upon this project if John decides to expand his website in the future. Lastly, I went with Netlify for hosting because it provides John with free hosting, a free SSL certificate, continuous deployment from GitHub (where the code is hosted), and their global CDN which makes for a speedy website regardless of the userâ€™s location.</p>

        <p>This was the first full-fledged project that I built using React. I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge utilizing React, including the implementation of React Hooks and React-Router. Integrating the headless CMS, Sanity, proved more challenging than I initially anticipated, however, I managed to get everything working properly. This was also the first time that I worked on a project across multiple devices, so it helped me gain a more in-depth understanding of Git and GitHub and proved to me just how powerful version control truly is. This was also my first time using the Tailwind CSS framework and Netlify for hosting.<br><br>Now that I have a better understanding of React, I feel more empowered to create larger projects using it in the future. I would like to dive more into the Tailwind CSS framework and utilize the customizations it offers because in this project I chose to stick with the built-in classes and I feel that the user interface could be improved. Netlify is an amazing hosting platform that was simple to use and it is definitely my new go-to for hosting static sites. Likewise, Sanity will be my choice for any future projects that need a content management system.</p>
